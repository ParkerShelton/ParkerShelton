    "desc": "We had to create a database full of projects and fetch them to display on the front end. We also had to create the whole front-end. After we got that, we had to create an admin page that will allow you to add/remove/edit the products. Our contact page had to also save all the contacts to a database that will display on the admin page. After all of that we had to authenticate for the admin page so only admins can see the admin page. I decided to make a store where you can order tattoo designs for a tattoo artist to trace. I love tattoos and art so it made this project extra fun for me to make!",
