##       LAYOUT        ##
#########################
  HOME:
    - HERO: My name and my main skills

    - BODY: List of projects. At first, the projects will open a modal that describes the project. After I'm finished, they will link to separate pages on my blog that show pictures, early designs, and text describing how and what I did.

  About:
    - HERO: Show a picture of me, the title of the page, and a short description of me.

    - BODY: Describes my past hobbies, current hobbies, and a description of my family with a picture of them.

    - MAP: Has a map(picture) of the states I've lived in, with colored pins in the relative area that I lived. Next to the map, there will be pictures of the pins and a short history of the state i lived in. The pins will correspond to the description of the states so they match.

    - RESUME: A pdf of my resume at the bottom of the page

  CONTACT:
    - FORM: After you put all of the information asked by th form, it will create an email with all the fields filled out with the input of the user. That email will be sent to me when they hit send. There will be a recaptcha and a simple math problem to try and stop robots from spamming me.

  BLOG: 
    - BLOG: For the first few versions, the blog will be hidden. I will only keep it hidden while I finish the rest of the site for Road to Hire. A modal will pop up and explain the project, and once I have time to make the blog, the projects will have a link to the blog too.

    - PAGES: Each page will go into depth of the selected project. It will talk about everything I tried, even if it didn't make it into the final result, it will show all of the sketches and concepts I came up with in the beginning, the steps I took to finish the project, any problems I had, and also go step by step in how to recreate it so anyone else can learn how to do what I did. I want it to show my abilities, but also help others that are trying to do something similar to me. I will create the blog with wordpress and have a specific page for the whole blog. On projects that aren't personal or private, ill share the whole project on my github and give a link to it. I'll still explain how I did the more private projects but not give out any source material. Once I get a job, I'll share every project I can, but wont give out any info I shouldn't and i wont give out any source material unless I am allowed.
